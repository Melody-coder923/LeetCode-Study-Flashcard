# LeetCode 136. Single Number — Problem Summary

---

## Problem Summary  
Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears **twice** except for one element which appears **once**, find the element that appears only once.

---

## Key Points  
- Each number except one appears **exactly twice**.  
- The task is to find the unique number that appears only once.  
- The solution should have **linear runtime complexity** (O(n)) and use **constant extra space** (O(1)).

```
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result=0
        for i in nums:
            result^=i
        return result
```

---

## Core Insight  
Using the **bitwise XOR operation**, all numbers appearing twice cancel each other out because `a XOR a = 0`. XORing all elements results in the single number that doesn’t have a duplicate.

---

## Why XOR works  
- XOR is **commutative** and **associative**.  
- Pairwise XOR of identical numbers is 0.  
- XOR with 0 returns the number itself.

---

## Use Cases  
- Finding unique elements in datasets where duplicates occur in pairs.  
- Useful in problems involving bit manipulation and optimization.
